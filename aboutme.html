                    <p>Now I am looking to find a career in Technology since it is something that I loved so much as a teen and can also provide a comfortable way of life. I hope to pursue a career in website design or software engineering.
                        These courses have also taught me that I enjoy python and java. I don't have a link or picture for today.
